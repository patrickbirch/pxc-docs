## Release highlights

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL. Find a complete list of improvements and bug fixes in the [Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.40-43 (2022-11-28)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/5.7/release-notes/5.7.40-43.html).

The improvements and bug fixes for MySQL 5.7.40, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* ISO 8601 timestamps in log messages did not consider daylight saving time when --log-timestamps=SYSTEM was used.

* The GRANT OPTION privilege was treated as related to database operations.

* In specific cases, a TRUNCATE TABLE operation failed to release an acquired mutex.

* A descending b-tree scan raised a debug assertion failure in debug builds.
