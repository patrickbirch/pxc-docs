For information about the changes
and new features introduced in Percona Server 5.7,
see [Changed in Percona Server 5.7](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/changed_in_57.html).

## New Features

This is a list of the most important features introduced in Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7 compared to version 5.6

* [PXC Strict Mode](../features/pxc-strict-mode.md#pxc-strict-mode) saves your workload from experimental and unsupported features.

* Support for monitoring Galera Library instruments
and other wsrep instruments as part of Performance Schema.

* Support for encrypted tablespaces in Multi-Master Topology,
which enables Percona XtraDB Cluster to wire encrypted tablespace to new booting node.

* Compatibility with ProxySQL, including a quick configuration script.

* Support for monitoring Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes using
[Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)

* More stable and robust operation with MySQL and Percona Server version 5.7.14,
as well as Galera 3.17 compatibility. Includes all upstream bug fixes, improved logging and more.

* Simplified packaging for Percona XtraDB Cluster to a single package
that installs everything it needs, including the Galera library.

* Support for latest XtraBackup with enhanced security checks.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed crash when a local transaction (such as `EXPLAIN` or `SHOW`)
is interrupted by a replicated transaction with higher priopiry
(like `ALTER` that changes table structure and can thus affect the result of the local transaction).

* Fixed DONOR node getting stuck in `Joined` state after successful SST.

* Fixed error message when altering non-existent table with `pxc-strict-mode` enabled.

* Fixed path to directory in `percona-xtradb-cluster-shared.conf`.

* Fixed setting of `seqno` in `grastate.dat` to `-1` on clean shutdown.

* Fixed failure of asynchronous TOI actions (like `DROP`) for non-primary nodes.

* Fixed replacing of `my.cnf` during upgrade from 5.6 to 5.7.

## Security Fixes

* CVE-2016-6662

* CVE-2016-6663

* CVE-2016-6664
