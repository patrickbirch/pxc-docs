## Release Highlights

The following list contains some of the bug fixes for MySQL 5.7.36, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona XtraDB Cluster for MySQL:


* Fix for the possibility of a deadlock or failure when an undo log truncate operation is initiated after an upgrade from *MySQL* 5.6 to *MySQL* 5.7.


* Fix for when a parent table initiates a cascading `SET NULL` operation on the child table, the virtual column can be set to NULL instead of the value derived from the parent table.


* On a view, the query digest for each SELECT statement is now based on the SELECT statement and not the view definition, which was the case for earlier versions.
